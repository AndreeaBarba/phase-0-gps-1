* What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?  
Merging and merge conflicts.  
* What concepts were clarified during the GPS?  
Branching, in particular feature branching and the usefulness of it. Our guide explained the concept with an example that made things very clear.  
* What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?
I asked our guide to clarify how a pairing session should be, I asked about merging and about the add and commit command.  
*What still confuses you about Git?
I think I still have to look into the workflow when adding and commiting files that are in the same repository, but in different subfolders.  
* How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?
I didn't know what to expect from it, was kinda nervous at first, but my pair and the guide were great people to work with and I got to feel comfortable collaborating with them. I had to apologize for the background noise there was in the coffee shop I was working from. It's not an excuse, but I really thought there would a more quiet atmosphere.
