**What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?**
I struggled with the difference between git fetch and git pull. I also did not completely understand how merge conflicts worked.

**What concepts were clarified during the GPS?**
The GPS further clarified on feature branches and commits.

**What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?**
I asked the GPS about difference between git pull and git fetch. I asked my pair if she had dealt with merge conflicts before since I had not.

**What still confuses you about Git?**
For the merge conflict portion, I used the command line "git merge small_conflict" from the master branch. The merge conflict was then fixed in Sublime and committed change. The changes were saved correctly in the md file in both branches, however only the original commit message in the small_conflict branch (prior to the merge) was pushed to Github. I thought that the commit message about the merge conflict would also appear, but perhaps I did not merge correctly.

**How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?**
I was quite nervous since this was my first pairing experience. It was a rough start due to background noise. The GPS was informative and my pair was helpful and patient. I had some technical issues with opening sublime on my local computer so I had to change computers and try to redo the merge conflict portion of the GPS again.
